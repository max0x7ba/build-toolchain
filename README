This directory contains makefiles for an in-house toolchain that currenly includes:

* gcc-5.2.0
* boost-1.58
* tbb-43_20140724oss

Several toolchains can be installed at the same time.

The compiler and binaries produced by it have rpath set, executing them does not require setting PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Prerequisites
=======
$ yum install bison flex texinfo {elfutils,libunwind,gettext,curl,sqlite,openssl,readline,bzip2,zlib,libpng,python}-devel

Building
========

Make sure that PATH is set to standard paths /usr/bin:/bin and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset.

Increment the number in file PREFIX. And then invoke:

$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
$ unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ mkdir -p `cat PREFIX`
$ sudo chown $USER `cat PREFIX`
$ make clean
$ make download
$ make -j12
